# Storyboard

Our vision is to foster innovation and creativity in the small business
             community. We aim to help entrepreneurs transform their ideas into 
             actionable plans through storytelling and visual mapping. By enabling 
             users to break down their goals and strategies into manageable segments, 
             we’re not just helping them plan—we're helping them envision their success.
             We use a Tech stack that includes React.js, Typescript, and Next.js to design
             and manage our web appllication.

## Using AI to help up and coming business owners

Additionally, our platform leverages Google's Gemini to assist you in creating logos, 
          names, and catchphrases that truly reflect your brand’s identity. Whether you’re 
          launching a startup or looking to rebrand, our tools are designed to spark 
          creativity and streamline your branding process.
